            You are proud as a master poet, 
            <br>

            Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit. 
            <br>
            One sadden moment I read your poetry,
            Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,
            What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.
            Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly, 
            <br>
            A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue, 
            Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,
            Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,
            Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence. 
            <br>Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,
            Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt, 
            <br>
            Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust, br
            Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.
